 <h2>Password Complexity</h2>
 <p>
For security purposes, it is recommended to change the password when using the Pay Portal for the first time. Passwords must be at least 8 characters long and contain 1 number, 1 Upper letter and 1 non-alphanumeric character. 
</p>

<h2>Forgot Password</h2>
 <p>
Your password can be sent to your email address. This confirms that you have access to the email account stored in Pay Portal.
</p>

<h2>No Error Detail</h2>
<p>
No error detail is given for failed login attempts. Whilst this is not very helpful to you, this helps stop an attacker from confirming they have used a username stored on the system.
</p>
<h2>Browser Compatibility</h2>
<p>
Whilst the system is compatible with all major browsers, users should not use versions of Internet Explorer older than 8.
