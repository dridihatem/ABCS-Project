                        <h2>Email Confirmation</h2>
<p>A confirmation link sent to your email address must be loaded before the account is enabled. This confirms that you have access to the email account stored in InPay.</p>

 <h2>Password Complexity</h2>
 <p>
Passwords must be at least 8 characters long and contain 1 number, 1 Upper letter and 1 non-alphanumeric character.
Maximum Incorrect Password Limit<br />
If a password is entered incorrectly 6 times, you will no longer be able to login, even if the correct password is entered. You must go through the password reset process (or registration) to be able to login. An administrator may also change this password to enable/test the account.
This limit is reset on every successful login.
</p>

<h2>No Error Detail</h2>
<p>
No error detail is given for failed login attempts. Whilst this is not very helpful to you, this helps stop an attacker from confirming they have used a username stored on the system.
</p>
<h2>Browser Compatibility</h2>
<p>
Whilst the system is compatible with all major browsers, users should not use versions of Internet Explorer older than 8
